INTRODUCTION:
Flache is a react web flashcard application with which users can make flashcards, update and delete flashcards. Users can also make their flashcards public for other users to see and they can also add public flashcards to their own set of flashcards. Users are required to put in the name of their schools to enable them see the flashcards of other users that attend their schools. This was a personal project created as a way for me to practice and learn more about CRUD applications and TypeScript.

TECHNOLOGIES:

TypeScript
JavaScript
